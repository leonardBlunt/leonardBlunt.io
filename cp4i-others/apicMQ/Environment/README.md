## Introduction to Cluster

If you're completely new to the concept of clusters, do follow the quick and easy tutorial [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_tutorial) to learn more
> With Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud®, you can create highly available clusters with virtual or bare metal worker nodes that come installed with the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Container Platform orchestration software. You get all the advantages of a managed offering for your cluster infrastructure environment, while using the Red Hat OpenShift tooling and catalog that runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux for your app deployments.

## Introduction to OpenShift

OpenShift is a platform that allows you to run containerized applications and workloads and is powered by Kubernetes. It is an offering that comes with Red Hat support, regardless of where you choose to run your applications and workloads. 

One of the big advantages of OpenShift is being able to take advantage of public and private resources which includes bare metal or virtualized hardware whether it is on-premise or on a cloud provider.

| [Event Stream + MQ](scenario5/index.md)      |  FictionCorp is a Online shopping company which recieves the user registration data and stores it in kafka cluster to be consumed by other subscribed applications. They want to use MQ Queue Manager to consume data from kafka topic for to notified downstream applications for new user registrations. <BR><BR> They have recently bought CP4I entitelment and exploring to use IBM Event Streams and MQ for implementing above user case.  | Event Streaming (IBM Event Stream) <BR><BR> Enterprise Messaging (IBM MQ) <BR><BR>Application Integration (IBM App Connect Enterprise)  | <strong>Sandeep </strong> Ved <BR><BR> <strong>Sujatha</strong> Sureshkumar

| [APIC + MQ](/scenario2/README.md)        | The XYZ Bank still has a core banking system running on IBM System Z. Currently the only way to integrate with this system is via MQ. The core banking system provides typical account functions such as query balance, deposit and withdraw. <BR><BR>The Bank has initiated a digital transformation program to modernize their channel applications such as Internet Banking, using reactive technology to make it more user friendly and compelling to their customers. They want to user APIs in order to quickly unlock their assets in the legacy systems - so that their channel applications can consume. <BR><BR>Security is paramount, they need to ensure that the APIs exposed needs to be secured using client id/secret and OAuth/OIDC. Architect and build a solution that enable the customer to expose their digital assets via APIs using Cloud Pak for Integration. Each transaction should trigger events that can be audited or based on business rules trigger alerts.| API Management (IBM API Connect)<BR><BR>Application Integration (IBM App Connect Enterprise)<BR><BR>Enterprise Messaging (IBM MQ) | <strong>Sandeep</strong> Ved<BR><BR><strong>Glen</strong> Christian   |

| [Integration Modernization](/scenario3/README.md)      |  Your customer has been a long-time user of App Connect (IIB/WMB) and MQ. They have recently decided to investigate the value of modernizing their integration. They are eager to explore IBM Agile Integration practices. <BR><BR>They would like you to use one of their existing flows and queue definitions to explore how to move to containerized integration. While eager to understand the modernization journey, they also have reservations on their ability to scale and manage the workload. <BR><BR>Demonstrate how to analyze, componentize, and containerize existing integration artefacts, and illustrate how to scale and monitor the new deployments.  | Enterprise Messaging (IBM MQ)<BR><BR>Application Integration (IBM App Connect Enterprise)  | <strong>Santhoshi </strong> Gopalkrishnan <BR><BR><strong>Mano </strong> Saelao

| [API Life Cycle Management](scenario4/ReadMe.md)      |  Your customer has been an OpenAPI definition for an exiting REST service. They have recently decided to investigate the value of modernizing their integration. They are eager to explore IBM API connect to deploy their rest services. <BR><BR>They would like you to create an API by importing the  OpenAPI definition for an existing REST service. Also configure Security endpoints, and proxy to invoke endpoint. After testing the REST API in the online developer toolkit, publish it API for their developers. <BR><BR>Demonstrate how to analyze, componentize, and containerize existing integration artefacts, and illustrate how to scale and monitor the new deployments.  | API Management (IBM API Connect) <BR><BR>Application Integration (IBM App Connect Enterprise)  | <strong>Sandeep </strong> Ved <BR><BR> Pham Manh <strong>Hung </strong>
